Introducing Hunting Ghislaine with John Sweeney

Remember this nutter. You were nutter at the beginning of that interview. That was me, John Sweeney, at my diplomatic best with the Church of Scientology. I'm back, this time investigating Ghislaine Maxwell. She denies applying underage sex slaves for a super rich american pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. Jelen has powerful friends, Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. I just wish her well, frankly. And someone closer to home, Prince Andrew, denies ever having met one of Jelin's alleged sex slaves, but can't explain the photo of the two of them together. Listen on global player or wherever you find your podcasts to hunting Jelen, a global original podcast.
