Make Some Noise Mystery Hour - How can I get my teddy sorted? - 8 Oct 15

this is lbc leading britain's conversation mystery hour with james o'brien call three four five six zero six zero nine seven three tweet text eight four eight five zero mystery hour with james o'brien on lbc three minutes after twelve is the time and you are listening to james o'brien on lbc where mystery hour is upon as your weekly opportunity to the sort of satisfaction that you do not ever achieve elsewhere what do i mean by that the who's the whys the whens the whats the wherefores the withers and either the whences something is bubbling away in the back of your mind that needs resolution oh three four five six zero six zero nine seven three is the number you need to ask that question james why do we do this where do we do that what is the reason for this what's the origin of that when i saw that thing happen what was the explanation of the thing that happened next seriously almost anything goes on mister hour as long as it's neither dull nor repetitious by which i mean something we've dealt with before and to be honest you quite often get away with repetition because we can't remember what we did yesterday let alone what we did last year there is a mystery hour archive heartily recommended over at lbc dot co dot uk and the best comparison i've ever been able to come up with is that this is sort of the radio equivalent or the broadcasting equivalent of the newspaper columns the notes and queries the q and a's where a reader writes in to ask a question and then hopes fingers crossed that some weeks later there will be an answer or some days later here we get the answer immediately so that there is a phone line for you if you hear somebody else ask a question to which you know the answer the number remains the same it gets very very busy but if you hear me say the number this is true for the whole fifteen hours that we spend together every week but it's particularly pertinent in this hour if you hear me say the number it means there is a phone line free just throw it throw a few coins in the pot i don't want anyone to feel they can't ring mystery out this week unless they're going to sort of donate fifty quid or something like that it's absolutely not the case a couple of pounds would be lovely and you're more than welcome to politely decline as well no one's going to be unimpressed as a result in fact the texts that have upset me the most today are the ones from the people telling me how much they'd love to donate but are genuinely skinned like this one here i've got no credit on my phone even james isn't there a landline option for me to donate i'll cover your fiverr all right seriously don't you worry about it oh three four five six zero six zero nine seven three is the number that you need to get your question on the board and be prepared just to put a few coins in the pot as well if you want to donate but you don't want to ring in then i'll remind you how you can do that as well remember that one hundred percent of your donation will go to globals make some noise so let's get the questions on the board zero three four five six zero six zero nine seven three is the number you need if you've got a question get it up if you hear somebody else ask a question get your answer up as quickly as possible i should stress because actually i forgot to mention this last week and someone slipped through the net you are not allowed to consult anything when providing an answer so if you hear somebody ask a question to which you know the answer ring in and answer it don't look it up you can't use any works of reference if you've learned it in the past from a work of reference that's great but you can't look it up today you can't google it or go online or search it it's all about illumination in fact i've tried to explain this to my children who love mystery hour and one of the things they love about it is the fact that it's actually learned knowledge rather than the way homework works these days they can google almost everything they're encouraged to it's great i completely understand why i'm not some sort of luddite who would stand in the way of that sort of progress but i do worry that it's changing the nature of memory and knowledge in the sense that you know why do you need to know what so and so said about such and such if you can literally google it in minutes i'd say for example yesterday some prune sent me that text that goes around on twitter sometimes saying that the winston churchill said the fascists of the future will be called anti fascists and i looked at that and i thought nah there's no way winston churchill ever said that two reasons a it doesn't really make any meaningful sense and b he was a much better orator than that so i just googled it and of course he didn't he never said that in his life not that it will stop the usual suspects from tweeting that sort of nonsense around the stratosphere and that it occurred to me then i was thinking crikey what would you have done before google how would you have been able to establish whether winston churchill had ever or not ever said that because what the internet provides is people who've read every word he ever wrote you'd have to be that person in order to provide that answer so that's why mystery house celebrates memory and knowledge should we go to brighton first i think we should jazz is there jaz question or answer hello hello jaz good morning to you how are you jaz are you well splendid yes yes i need to gently nudge you towards asking a question jaz there's no there's no rush we could just sit and chuckle at each other for five minutes sure we could sure we could sure we could to be sure right my question is whoa okay whoa okay back in the room yes here we go i would like someone out there to recommend a good shop in london where i can take my teddy bear and get my teddy bear valued is that really a mystery i mean this is mystery i'm not sort of the radio equivalent of yellow pages no well i know i could google it but if there's nothing like a personal recommendation we used to do a different hour actually it got nixed by management when they pointed out that it was sort of turning into a radio equivalent of an oxfam shop we used to do something called the treasure hunt but people would ring in and say i've got i'm missing a missing a milk jug from my royal wedgwood set and we'd find them reminds you've made me wistful for those days what makes you think your teddy is worth valuing jazz yes well because he belonged to my aunt and i think he's from the nineteen thirties forties yes nineteen thirties and forties so he's just very old that's why you think he might be valuable yes well he's he's very much loved is he a steve is he steve he could be well you got a sticker on him anywhere saying steve well apparently the steve bears had a had a little ear or a sticker has he got that uh no no but i think he might have had a voice box really i just feel that in the nineteen thirties goodness me yes well so how do i so your question for mystery is how do i get my teddy valued yes in london and it's got to be a shop why does it have to be in london what's wrong with brighton where you are there might be somewhere in brighton because i'm sure there isn't a good a good enough one in brighton and will you be seeking a second opinion or will you be going with the first that you receive i will look up the shop on the internet after someone recommends it how much are you hoping to raise i mean what would be good news for you are we looking for a sort of life changing sum of money here i'm sorry i will never sell him oh okay he will be put into my coffin when i go oh he's not worth too much someone might dig you up just to get the teddy just to get the teddy yes we better keep it secret if it goes into four figures i'm keeping it secret jaz i shall do my damnedest to get you an answer would you like to make a donation to make some noise i have already to your producer yes that's you just have to say it on air i would text it i would text it through fantastic that's very very kind of you thank you very much so five pounds from jaz teddy bear valuing okay how can jazz get her teddy bear valued anybody anyone bueller erin is in twickenham erin question or answer it's a question carry on aaron first i'm a bit confused if it's still mystery or something else but anyway you and me both pal let's try and raise the bar come on let's get it back in the room all right so i was in the garden having some food a couple of weeks ago i saw an ant on the table no way man off the table yeah i picked it off the table right i fell on the patio and scurried off yeah and i thought to myself well the height of that ant compared to the height is fallen and if you transpose that onto a person there's no way they would have made that fall so i wanted to know how high an ant can fall from before how high can an ant fall before getting hurt yeah cool i reckon we should be able to get i mean i promise i don't any ants to get hurt in the production of this answer i don't anyone to go out and start experimenting and bring me up and say third floor james ant still fine fourth floor oh well it just seems like a mystery i don't know it is a mystery it's a good mystery but i'm trying to work out how we can answer it without endangering any insects well maybe you can lure the professor onto the show i don't know if it's his field of expertise he's more sort of physics than insects i'll see i'll see what i can do would you like to make a donation to make some noise i already have good man is that well is that what's going to happen we should we should have thought this through obviously you've already spoken to the producer so i'll just leave it then do you have to make a donation to get on is that how we know you don't of course you don't that'd be unfair oh bloomin amateurs me eddie is in or sit in essex question or answer eddie it's a question please james carry on eddie um yeah i just want to know what why are guide dogs almost exclusively labradors it's obvious in it um couldn't use my new puppy as a guide doggy poor little thing get trodden on it's tiny i was gonna i was gonna ask if i could slide in a little side question concerning your puppy actually yeah of course you can i'm breaking all the rules for her so i don't see why mystery house would be any different i was just wondering why when you these designer dogs that are mixed with poodles why does the poodle part always come in the name why does the poodle part what the poodle part of the name of the dog once it's been mixed with another dog it always seems to be shunted to the second part of the name so it's either a labradoodle or a cockapoo or i've got a cavapoo i suppose a poo cava would sound a bit weird wouldn't it well i don't know it all sounds pretty weird doesn't it elaboradoodle poodle is there anything i told you there's no rules where my pup is concerned all the rules of the program we've established over twelve years have gone out the window just of all the rules of my life that i've established over forty three years with regard to dogs when out the window on sunday i don't know mate that's not really a mystery i prefer the other question and the answer is really simple they're just the best trained for it they've got the best set of attributes they're the best at learning combined with the best size combined with the best temperament all of the things you could train any dog at all to be a guide dog but they wouldn't be as good at it right okay i'll take that will you oh i mean i prefer someone to phone in and confirm it but no all right then i'll leave i'll leave it i'll leave it on the board but when it when when it's when it's confirmed i'm taking the applause for myself all right eddie have you made a donation to make some noise i've made a donation yeah good man appreciate it it's coming up to twelve fifteen you're listening to james o'brien on lbc this is lbc it's twenty minutes after twelve and you can help make a difference right now by donating five pounds or ten pounds to do so just text lbc five that's lbc f i v e or lbc ten l b c t e n no spaces no numbers and send that to seven zero zero seven zero that's seven thousand seven hundred text lbc five or lbc ten no spaces no numbers to seven zero zero seven zero one hundred percent of it will go to globals make some noise get the bill payers permission if you're under sixteen the vodafone foundation is going to match all the donations that you make up to a total of one hundred thousand pounds and the terms and conditions are all out makes noise dot com i don't know if the lawyers are going to let me do this but if you've got a question that's a bit rubbish i'll let it on this week if you make a massive donation all right so if you've got a rubbish question that you failed to get on mystery hour before for reasons of dullness tedium or rubbishness but you're prepared to give us a really flipping that would have been embarrassing must be something about the date if you make a massive donation then we'll let the rubbish question get through it's twenty one minutes after twelve eleanor is in ealink question or answer eleanor answer james carry on i the lady who phoned in about getting her teddy bear restored not restored valued value oh valued yeah oh i'm sorry i thought she said restored i was going to say anybody who wants to know about dolls or teddies to be restored for donkey's yours james we do belong to the same clan by the way the o'briens fantastic brian baron i've lost the name now i've took another one have you yes when i got married okay but james eleanor there is a dolls hospital and teddy bear hospital in habersmith for donkey's ears for donkey's ears yes well so if your donkey's ears fall off you can take it to the dolls hospital and put the ears back on now listen james don't be so smart she doesn't want it valued eleanor she wants she doesn't want it fixed she wants it valued oh well put you through did they tax you did they take some money off you as well for make some noise no i'm going they're going to phone me back and do that well you can't you can't we have to refund it now because you can't put no i haven't given it yet but i will give it no you put your purse away eleanor seriously because you should never have gone no i won't what would you put your purse away lady i don't want your money we don't want your money are you going to get it i don't want it you must take it all right you are stubborn you're lovely james i've run over twice before and we had great fun i was gonna say is it always this much fun we should do it again should make it a weekly occurrence oh we've done it many a time we did it for donkeys yes we have donkeys years now james you know i am from york clan you are i'm as mad as you are evidently and i'm not very well at the moment i'm sorry to hear that but you can get rid of me now well all right i shall i shall wave you on your way with it with a cheery farewell god bless eleanor and take care of yourself it's twenty three minutes after twelve don't want a hospital we want it valued not not fixed helen is in tunbridge wells question or answer helen hello jane it's an answer and it's a bit of a cheeky request well then i'm gonna have to charge you well i am no i've said both my me and my little boy thomas we both agreed to sort of donate towards the amazing cause in that we could possibly try and answer a question from last week which i know you don't normally do rules rules was rules but if i mean how much are you going to donate this week we're going to donate fifty pounds yeah fill your boots go on have a crack answer anything you want thank you well it's only recently up in my thomas's history project he was really excited that he might be able to answer and i'll take the hopefully round of applause on his behalf how old is thomas he's ten is he at school he is thomas when you listen to this on the podcast if your mum is about to embarrass herself then you and me can pretend this never happened all right mate but if your mum does really really well the applause is all for you carry on it was the origin of the word nickname oh i love that question yes i know and that's why i was so excited to phone back he did a project about names and why we have names and things like that and that cropped up in it and it originates back from the anglo saxon times because we didn't have surnames in those times and so the anglo saxons introduced an additional name to sort of make people stand out more so it might be his name was john but they also called him stubbly chin or red beard large belly yes and in anglo saxon that was called an eek name which i think was spelled eek and then just as english has evolved it's turned into a nickname and eventually a nickname that is why i love mystery hour right there right there that's why i love mystery hour eek name so sort of ethel read the unready the unready would be his eke name exactly would have been his eke name yeah isn't that cool it's more than cool it's absolutely brilliant thomas mate i'm so proud of you well done and that was all right as well by you helen i suppose do you want a round of applause oh yes please yeah fair enough thank you helen thank you thomas twenty five minutes after twelve you're listening to james o'brien on lbc professor howell's up next so i'll build a bit of tension by reminding you of the auction that's currently unfolding over at lbc dot co dot uk i'm just going to be careful what i click on here because i'm not part of the prize yet twenty four minutes to go before you can get your hands on this marvelous marvelous prize it's a trip to washington dc but let me just run through what the trip actually involves it's an astonishing

to be to place that winning bid back to mystery hour professor howell is in brighton that's because he's the professor of the public understanding of science at the university of brighton and he joins me on the line now professor howell question or answer it's an answer james you were invited weren't you by the earlier caller he said maybe the professor will ring in and here you are as if by magic it was a clarion call and it's actually not unrelated to some answers we've had a run of these kind of gravity related questions and it's all to do with terminal velocity of course it is do you remember we talked about an anvil falling and never actually reaching terminal velocity because there's no up thrust capable of slowing it down yes and ant's completely different ants got a small mass and it's very very buoyant and it's actually going to fall in much the same way as a leaf does it's almost going to flow down and so never really reach its terminal velocity will be reached so quickly it's never ever going to do any damage by the half mv squared of kinetic energy when it hits the ground and a peripheral first answer is it's got quite a robust exoskeleton as you might recall of course so they're not particularly breakable so its bones are on the outside sort of thing yeah yeah so you could drop an ant from anywhere you could drop out the space shuttle and i mean leaving aside issues of respiration it could theoretically float safely to the ground technically but i think it'll probably go into orbit yeah yes they just won't they will just not reach any sort of worthwhile speed and therefore they won't hurt themselves so erin sitting in his garden letting his hairs be the antennaes to another universe wondering about where the ants could hurt themselves and then fall off his patio table the answer is they could it could have fallen off the house could have fallen off a ten story house next door and it still would have landed on his patio unscathed exactly very quickly the buoyancy equals the acceleration due to gravity it doesn't accelerate anymore the net force is zero and then it just sort of gently flows to ground and scuttles off a round of applause for the hang on have you donated to make some noise tenor well played round of applause for professor hat half past twelve is the time twenty six minutes to one you're listening to james o'brien on lbc there's a couple of phone eyes free actually and if you're one of the people that routinely moans about not being able to get onto mystery hour because whenever you get through you're sort of told that your question isn't good enough make a big enough donation to make some noise you can get on today with some right old rubbish seriously five six zero six zero nine seven three is the number you need that is also the number you need if you can answer any of the questions we've already got on the board namely where can you go to get a teddy bear valued that's a slightly odd question for mister we should really have hit jazz for a lot more money on that question i hadn't come up with the idea of charging you for poor questions at that stage in the program but anyway better late than never so where can jaz go to get her teddy bear valued she's fairly confident it must be worth a lot of money because she's had it since the or it's been around since the nineteen thirties or beyond why are guide dog dogs mostly labrador as well low three four five six zero six zero nine seven three we did the insects question professor howe's done that was there anything else on the board is it just the teddy bear and the guide dogs i think it is so if you can answer either of those you know what to do if you've got a question of your own similarly you know what to do steve's in kenton question or answer steve james i had a question for you well actually it's a question i've been something that's puzzled me for an awful long time but i've been too afraid to ask for fear of ridicule i'd never really ridden you get me mixed up with someone else steve i don't really do ridicule no in the general okay what it is now i'm sure it must have been explained to me at school i was probably looking out the window in science but it's one of these fundamental things why does ice float in water what sort of answer do you want well if i say because it's less dense than water would that be satisfactory i suspect not well no because surely that's what's puzzled because it just came to this is what's always come to me one thing i do remember in science is something freezes once something becomes a solid it actually becomes more dense usually yes but water is an exception to that because of the way that hydrogen bonds ah here we go we got an answer then is that it is that enough because if you wanted me to explain how simple i just missed all these years well it is bond it's hydrogen bonding i got taught this at school and remarkably it was one of the rare days when i wasn't looking out the window but but it is probably not going to end prettily if i try and go into any further detail you need to imagine an x an x an x as in the letter x okay i thought you said an egg no just an x leave the eggs out of it you need to imagine an x and the oxygen molecule is at the center of the x and at the end of the two bottom legs of the x you've got hydrogen molecules and at the top end of the x that that's where that's where all the sort of density stuff goes on and bonding and things i can see why i looked out the window yeah but that is the answer is that ice is less dense than water and the reason it's less dense than water is because of how hydrogen bonds and water of course is h two okay i'll take that i don't feel i don't feel like no you shouldn't professor hal will be annoyed that he came in early on the ant question he'll be sitting there going oh my god that's such a flipping amateurish answer but it's actually correct i just probably could have gone into a little bit more detail okay have you have you have you made a pledged have you made a pledge have you pledged yeah thank you ten pounds i did yes good man everyone's a winner great work round of applause for me speaking of everyone being a winner twelve thirty eight is the time glenn is in romford glenn question or answer james it's a question good afternoon to you hello glenn i'm impressed by the answer you just gave by the way thank you very much cost my parents a fortune that sort of knowledge i tell you well um my question is the phrase and pigs may fly yeah what's that all about that's your question yeah well what pigs might fly what's that all about in well you can only ask you can only ask one question can you that's correct well hang on you've just disproved that you just asked your second one well i've phrased it in the most in the most encompassing so you mean the origin of the phrase you mean the origin of the phrase origin what the date would be handy is it an english phrase how much have you pledged well i've got a problem i'm having a senior moment last night being a good boy scout i overpaid my mobile phone by ten pounds okay do you think i can get it through what do you mean i just can't send oh don't worry no that's fine i just presumed given that i'd said if you were going to ask a rubbish question you'd have to make a massive donation i presumed you dropped a couple of grand in the pot or something like that was it that there yeah oh crikey well i've already made a donation online but if somebody can tell me how to operate my don't worry glenn mate you've done you've done you've done fine it's not that bad a question i just can't believe we haven't done it but everyone knows what it means the phrase pigs might fly it's if i said for example i'm going to win an award tomorrow for being the modest most modest presenter on british radio and glenn would say oh yeah pigs might fly as well it just means something that's highly highly unlikely indeed but where it comes from i don't know ok we'll get it thank you very much thank you very much twelve forty is the time can you answer that question the origins of flying pigs the valuing of teddy bears there's a sort of animal element to all of this teddy bear guide dog flying pig take your pick and we've just gone over the five thousand pound mark on washington so actually i should have picked a higher number because that's what i said i wanted to achieve and we've achieved it with ten minutes to spare so what that means is that if you want to win this amazing amazing trip to washington and look i know five grand is a heck of a lot of cash the point is this if you quite fancy the sound of the trip and you're lucky enough to be in quite a comfortable situation financially instead of paying the money to the actual companies that would then make a profit out of you you can pay the money and the companies have given it to us to sell to you so it all goes to make some noise so you could go on holiday devoid of any sense of guilt or shirking or ducking away from the daily grind avoiding the rarest you can go on holiday for five nights to washington dc you can have an amazing time and every night when you pour yourself a glass of wine which you could easily afford with your dollar five hundred preloaded visa gift card you can say to yourself well not only am i enjoying a glass of wine and a delicious dinner which will probably involve cheese because this is america and they will put cheese on almost everything be warned you could congratulate yourself on having helped people through your donation as well people like freddie and his family who you met earlier people like the young people that go to the michael palin center michael was in earlier telling us about the stammering research undertaken by the charity that he supports that's just a lovely idea i love the idea of being able to go on holiday and have that warm glow of satisfaction knowing that you've done something decent twelve forty one so it's currently at five thousand one hundred one pounds i want to see it go higher come on guys get over to lbc dot co dot uk dot i want to fight there's two people here in there is there two people now there's two two people having a having a scrap come on don't let that wow he's calling you names now that whoever was on five thousand pounds now we're on five thousand one hundred one pounds he's laughing at you he's going to washington you're not you're not he's going to wash or she or she indeed calm down twelve forty two rachel's in putney question or answer rachel oh god i almost forgot the whole thing yeah because i wanted to give some money and i and my my mobile phone doesn't work in this house anyhow the charity people are going to phone me back thank you thank you very much where does shanks's pony come from is that a ridiculous old question no i like it i don't think i might have said it because i'm an ancient crowd grown rod nonsense i'm an old but yes ma'am no you're not no no no well i am well you're not i'm not no i don't allow bats on this program on this particular subject of the subject of shanks his ponies no on on mystery out yes okay well that's another animal this is quite weird teddy bears guide dogs flying pigs and shanks's pony younger listeners will need me to explain what shanks his pony is rachel it is a reference to one's legs so you could say you could go by car by train or you could of course go by shanks's pony which would mean you would walk is that right yes yes now do you know what shanks means no well i think that's the answer have you never had lamb shanks yes i had some last night and isn't it a small world eh so you had it for dinner last night but you've never heard of it before oh you have to use a bit of brain you see i think mine's going lamb shanks and also wasn't there a monarch some pre tudors called edward longshanks i don't know that would have been his eke name oh we are knitting them together today edward longshanks you're going to be able to clap i think so shanks just means legs so shanks his pony just means your legs of course it does i'm delighted to have given you a clapping very very neat insertion of the ing on the end of that rachel one of these people ring me back bless you thank you so much only a tenor but anyway only a tenor every little help it's twelve forty four rachel many thanks two rounds of applause for me today it's a shame in a way because we could have had shanks's pony guide dogs teddy bears and flying pigs origins of the phrase flying pigs where's wayne embassildon when you need him answer he's been working in suffolk a lot lately he sent me an email to apologise for his failure to join in on mystery out wired guide dogs mostly labradors and where can jazz take her teddy bear to be valued jane's in uxbridge jane question or answer i have a question and my question is also for jonesy your engineer is it ah now here's one that you won't be able to answer james or at least i actually do you know i've just realized he's not supposed to be here anymore he's moved on to a new job but he's come back for mystery hour this week it's the first time i've seen him all week well noticed jane carry on well my question then is which is the back and which is the front of a pair of tights why for us ladies i already said you won't be able to answer this james why would jones know about this well your researcher chap said he would oh i see he's the expert on tights what's the front and what's the back i mean does it so what you want to know how you put your tights on exactly james and wherever you buy your tights there's never any instructions in the package and seriously james yeah it's like manipulating the length of cheese wire it's like what ladies so what are you doing with these ties wire what it's like manipulating no i heard you i just i heard you i was just trying to get rid of the mental image thank you very much i was giving myself a moment a little bit of mind bleach thank you very much um hang on can can you tell when you've got them on wrong yes you can because you either end up looking like nora bhatti or they twist all around one leg so you can only tell when you've got them on whether you've got them on right or wrong yes and you want to know how you can tell which way around to put them on just by looking at them before okay actually quite like i actually quite like that question now i want to give some answers you may get james if that's okay because some ladies may ring in and say there's a little stitching in the back yes or the toes indicate the right way but not in most heights okay you're on jane tell which way around her tights should go without actually having to put them on i shall do my doubt have you made a donation yes i have james okay thank you very much where are we up to now where are we up to on the holiday thank you jane where are we up to on the holiday where are we up to on the holiday we might have five thousand one hundred and one pounds there's three minutes left when we come back after the break we'll know whether five thousand one hundred and one pounds was the winning bid but if you're the person that the winning bidder just outbid i would personally be very surprised if you're going to let that lie seriously it's a bit like a sort of he's biting his thumb at you sir do you bite your thumb at me sir no sir i do bite my thumb but not at you he's biting his thumb at you sir you want to get in there you want to make another bid you want to get over to lbc dot co dot uk and i'll tell you what whoever wins you can take jones with you to washington if you want there you go how's that have you got any more holiday owed it goes on more holidays than judith chump no apparently i'm not allowed to actually offer up my colleagues for auction it's ridiculous seriously it wouldn't have happened under the romans twelve fifty one is the time you're listening to james o'brien on lbc raising some money today and the bid has now been completed on this auction thank you five thousand pounds was the amount i wanted to and we've managed to raise five thousand one hundred and one pounds so whoever you are have a fantastic time in washington dc and although this is a slightly sort of glib figure of speech i do actually mean it send us a postcard let us know how you're getting on we'll read it out on air twelve fifty two is the time back to mystery hour we still need to know about the origin of the phrase flying pigs where you can go to get a teddy bear valued and why guide dogs are mostly labradors got time for a couple more questions as well tim's in shepherd's bush tim question or answer question james go on why in america specifically when a dead body is found male female is referred to as john doe and then as a female jane doe not just unidentified male or unidentified female really was like the first dead person actually when he found out his identity called john doe and it stuck it's like a sort of it's like our john smith or joe bloggs a name that's used for someone who hasn't got a name yet exactly but i don't think they call them john smith in britain if someone is identified i didn't just call them no you're probably right yeah in america they always refer to this john doe person did he want to know where it comes from yeah i like that what's the first person who's actually dead if you like and when they found out who he was he actually was called john doe and it stuck i jane doe i guess was the opposite of john i'm trying to keep you talking in the hope that some sort of little glimmer of knowledge will come floating back from the dim and distant past but i got to tell you nothing's happening i thought you were the knowledge of fountain of all knowledge jane no that's just the that's just the impression i try to give usually failing miserably john doe john doe no i thought we'd done that before as well have we not done that no okay what why why is an unidentified body called john doe you see it a lot on crime shows in america don't you have you have you made a donation tim to mason thanks for that mate we'll try and get you an answer we haven't got long actually i should stop burbling oh three four five six zero six zero nine seven three if you can answer that question adams in aldgate adam question or answer it's a simple one really i'd like to understand helicopter flies i'm completely baffled by how a helicopter flies yeah it's baffling no well is it what sort of explanation do you want you mean it goes right the propeller goes round and round and round around how does it take off well i'd like to i like to understand the science behind it it's it's it's sorry i'm just a bit i'm a bit confused by when you said it was a simple one i don't think that's a simple one at all are you going to be talking about up thrust and kinetic energy and all sorts of complicated issues no well maybe it's me who's simple but it's an interesting one it is a very interesting one we've only got four or five minutes left to do it if you know how clear me a couple of phone lines quick this is important we need to know how a helicopter flies we needed we needed the professor we needed the professor hal always does this he she goes too early adam have you made a donation to make some noise i well i haven't as of yet what i'd like to say though is thank you incidentally what's interesting is that i was actually the first person helped by the michael palin stammering center shut the front door i was i was so i was i was in the paper with michael oh mate that's lovely i must have been maybe twelve or thirteen i could barely get a sentence out they obviously were incredibly supportive and helped me a lot so it's a thank you to them specifically to michael to some of the financiers who helped to set it up the ronsons and to all the staff there and to you for helping them out but i would like to make a donation of pound three hundred and really say thank you to them and thank you to you it's a good job we're near the end of the show actually that's really lovely that's one of the nicest moments i've ever had on the radio thank you blimey and it's a lovely reminder for everybody listening that we're talking about real people not just the people you've met today other people you've heard on the radio but people like adam as well who just by complete coincidence you just had me on in the car today adam or something and you heard us talking to michael earlier i listened to lbc i'm just going into town and i did just hear this and hear you and heard us generous of do you really need to know how a helicopter flies do you really want to know how a helicopter flies or was that just just the way of getting in to be so decent that was that was a question to get on and just say thank you to you guys right well let's get him an answer let's get him an answer anyway adam you're a star mate that's a lovely moment and a lovely thing to do three hundred pounds for the make some noise and one of the charities we're supporting their action for stammering children which is behind the michael palin center and which turned adam from someone who couldn't get a center to buy his own description into someone who you'd never have known in a million years and listening to him that his life had ever been affected by stammering douglas is in windsor question or answer douglas it's an answer james the teddy bear one oh hallelujah it's a fantastic old shop must have been there for centuries called asquith's in henley okay i remember taking some of my parents teddy bears there in the last ten or so years and some of them had price tags on of two and six and the stock i think she's hoping for more than that she was hoping for more than that douglas no no that was the price when my grandmother bought it so when we took it in there we were quite surprised of the several hundred pounds that it was valued at and there are ones in there which are thousands of pounds and that's the only place i know and i think it's it's fairly much a world famous oh lovely and they specialize in teddy bears it's a world famous teddy they sell new ones as well or do they just do and antique ones no they do have they do have new ones as well but the most sought after ones are really the old ones the antique or vintage or veteran or whatever you'd like to call i think they call them both actually depending on their age that's a lovely lovely little bit of knowledge and jazz in brighton will be delighted to discover that i'm sure she'll be able to get to henley as opposed to london what was the most valuable one you took in pound two hundred seventy five better than a kick in the teeth isn't it have you made have you donated all of it so if i kept it it probably would worth more now have you donated all of that to make some noise or just a small fraction there was a small fraction of that that my partner donated yesterday she has three mentally handicapped children and she's doing a swimathon thing as well and she donated i'll take this as well with my compliments thank you quickly for june in orpington on the guide dogs make it snappy june yeah sure dicapri doors are genetically fairly robust whereas most of the other large dogs have got a variety of genetic defaults like alsatians have clicky hips and they're prone to clicky hips yeah they're probably used to be in a band called clicky hips give june a round of applause quickly because we're going to run out of time and we can't afford to crash into any of sheila's moments that's it for me for today thank you everybody seriously we'll do it again tomorrow morning from ten o'clock this is lbc here is sheila fogan thank you
